# Stereolithography_CLIP_3D_Printing
Code to convert .stl files to bitmaps for custom stereolithography and CLIP printers

During my PhD at Northwestern, I designed, and wrote software to control, Stereolithography and CLIP based 3D printers.  In the long term, this repository will include both a little information about the 3D printers that I built as well as the code to convert any .stl file into information that these printers can use and the LabVIEW code that was used to run the printers.

# Designing the 3D Printer

The 3D printer was designed using SolidWorks 3D modeling software.
